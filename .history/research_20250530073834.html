            <h2>Hypernuclear Physics (Strange Particles, Literally)</h2>
            <p>
                Ever wondered what happens when you replace a neutron or proton with hyperon 
                in a nucleus?
                My research dives into the weird and wonderful world of hypernuclear physics, 
                where baryons get strange (pun intended). Current highlights include:

                    <strong>J-PARC E73 Hypertriton Lifetime Puzzle:</strong> Aiming to solve the 
                    mysterious hypertriton lifetime puzzle using the innovative

                    reaction. We're using a PbF₂ calorimeter to catch those sneaky high-energy gamma rays 
                    and nail down the lifetime with unprecedented precision. (Take that, heavy-ion experiments!)

                    we're isolating SRC contributions like never before. (Because who needs conventional methods anyway?)

                    during my Ph.D. (2004-2009). Yes, I was that grad student who actually found

            <p>
                Kaons are like the quirky cousins of the particle family. My work explores their 
                interactions and exotic states, revealing the secrets of strangeness in nuclear

            <h2>Antideuteron-Nucleus Interactions (Antimatter Adventures)</h2>
            <p>
                What happens when antimatter meets ordinary nuclei? My research at J-PARC's K1.8 beam line 
                is designed to find out! This cutting-edge experiment explores antideuteron-nucleus interactions 
                to unlock the secrets of the strong nuclear force in antimatter systems. Current objectives include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Optical Potential Determination:</strong> Mapping out the antideuteron-nucleus 
                    optical potential using advanced detection methods and the GiBUU transport model. 
                    (Because understanding antimatter interactions isn't exactly straightforward.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Annihilation Mechanisms:</strong> Investigating how antideuterons annihilate 
                    by measuring partial to coherent annihilation cross-section ratios and analyzing 
                    pion momentum distributions. (Yes, we're literally watching antimatter disappear.)
                </li>

                    <strong>Future Antimatter Studies:</strong> Opening new doors for antimatter research 
                    by deepening our understanding of antideuteron properties and antinucleon physics. 
                    (Because antimatter deserves its moment in the spotlight.)

            <p>
                When I’m not unraveling the mysteries of the universe, I tinker with technology 
                to make experiments better. Here are some of my proudest creations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Proposing an energy-sensitive Muon Spin Resonance (muSR) spectrometer that 
                    improves precision by 1.5x.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dreaming a waveform analysis method for drift chambers, achieving 40 μm 
                    resolution in simulations. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating a streaming DAQ system for real-time data analysis and leading a 
                    Plate Cherenkov detector project for particle identification.
